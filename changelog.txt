V0.1.0
+ Fixed the new Bug
+ Mapping now works perfectly, both making a new mapping and opening an old one

V0.0.4
+ Added functionality to load a mapping
+ Added functionality to save multiple mappings with the same name (it adds a number at the end to differentiate)
- Bug discovered: Loading and reading from the mapping dictionary is kind of iffy occasionally, so I'm going to rethink the way I do that for V0.1.0

V0.0.3
+ Fixed the coordinate issue

V0.0.2
+ Added Basic Changelog functionality
+ Added mapping saving functionality (cannot load yet)
    - Also the mapping save functionality doesn't take into account that one might have repeat names, but this will only come into play later on 
+ Made a first attempt at mapping keys to clicks, but there are calibration issues
    - Namely, if I tell it to move to (x, y), it moves to (1.25x, 1.25y). I'm not sure why but it can be mitigated
    - Unsure if this would affect other machines differently :/

V0.0.1
