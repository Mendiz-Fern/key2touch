V0.0.3
* Fixed the coordinate issue

V0.0.2
* Added Basic Changelog functionality
* Added mapping saving functionality (cannot load yet)
    - Also the mapping save functionality doesn't take into account that one might have repeat names, but this will only come into play later on 
* Made a first attempt at mapping keys to clicks, but there are calibration issues
    - Namely, if I tell it to move to (x, y), it moves to (1.25x, 1.25y). I'm not sure why but it can be mitigated
    - Unsure if this would affect other machines differently :/

V0.0.1
* No changelog entries yet
