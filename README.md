3I just wanted to have a small program that maps key presses to touchscreen directives so I can play a specific mobile game on my computer through screen mirroring. 
At the moment, it doesn't have a GUI becuase... well... it's python. I'll try to come up with a GUI at some point, since this form of doing stuff is very archaic, not gonna lie.

<h3>V0.0</h3>
Created the Python file. That's about it

<h3>V0.0.3</h3>
Have a funcional mapper. this is more akin to Key-to-Click, as it doesn't emulate touch screen just yet
In order to use k2t, run the python script and follow the instructions when prompted. Some things to note though: 
* Loading profiles does not work as of V0.0.3, so every time you boot, you'll have to remake your mapping each time you open
* You cannot open any other app (at the moment) while making the mapping, but if you have it open already, you can swtich the window to it while the mapper is open

This issues will be fixed later
