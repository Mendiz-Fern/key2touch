I just wanted to have a small program that maps key presses to touchscreen directives so I can play a specific mobile game on my computer through screen mirroring. 
At the moment, it doesn't have a GUI becuase... well... it's python. I'll try to come up with a GUI at some point, since this form of doing stuff is very archaic, not gonna lie.

<h3>V0.0<\h3>
Created the Python file. That's about it
